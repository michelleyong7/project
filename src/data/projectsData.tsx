    description: "I created this project to deepen my understanding of how SaaS businesses track performance and make data-informed decisions. Using mock data, I explored key metrics like revenue growth, churn, and customer lifetime value. My goal was to bring these numbers to life through a dashboard that tells a storyâ€”not just with data, but with clarity and purpose. This experience allowed me to practice end-to-end analysis, from writing SQL queries to visualizing insights with Streamlit, all while honing my ability to translate technical work into meaningful business understanding.",
